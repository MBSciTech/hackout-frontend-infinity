A map-based tool is needed to grow the hydrogen ecosystem by visualizing existing and planned assets (plants, storage, pipelines, hubs) and guiding new investments. It should integrate infrastructure, renewable sources, demand centers, and logistics, while recommending project sites based on proximity to renewables, demand, regulations, and costs.

Identifying where to grow the hydrogen ecosystem requires a map-based tool that
visualizes all existing/planned assets (plants, storage, pipelines, distribution hubs) and uses 
data-driven models to guide new investments. This problem involves creating an 
interactive map layered with infrastructure data, renewable energy sources, demand
centres, and transport logistics. The tool should offer site selection recommendations for 
new projects based on criteria such as proximity to renewable generation, market 
demand, regulatory zones, or cost optimization.
User:
Urban and regional planners, energy companies, project developers, policy analysts.
Impact:
● Directs capital to high-impact, high-yield infrastructure projects.
● Avoids redundant investment, minimizing costs and land use.
● Facilitates coordinated growth of hydrogen networks supporting net zero 
ambitions.
